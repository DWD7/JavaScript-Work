                    This website is about my favorite anime and anime related things. Each page will hold different content.<br>
                    <u>Home</u> is just the main page for this site, giving information about the other pages.<br>
                    <u>Anime List</u> will contain animes that i like, am looking forward to, or those i want to watch.<br>
                    <u>Games</u> will have games that i like that are either based off of an anime, or those that look like they are.<br>
                    <u>Websites</u> will show what websites you can watch anime from, whether they be subscription based or not.<br>
                    <u>About</u> will give information about the author (That's me!). Probably just an email, and maybe my name.<br>

                    I look forward to adding to this in the future. HTML isn't as annoying as i thought it would be, and i find it to be similar to java.
                    It's just that the braces are tags instead, but i do like how it looks, and it's fun once you get used to it.
                    It's much easier to access files in HTML than the other languages i've used.
                    I enjoy how CSS allows for ease of changing style and colors.

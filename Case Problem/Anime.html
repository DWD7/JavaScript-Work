                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Overlord</h3>
                <p>
                    It was well received by most people i know, and I find it to be tied for my favorite with the next one on the list.
                    I love the idea of FDVR (Full Dive Virtual Reality), and i enjoy isekai animes. This starts off as a FDVR anime, and becomes an isekai.
                    I enjoy the darkness it holds, and the moments of comedy that relieve viewers of the dark nature of the anime.
                    I've read the light novels for this, and they just get better with each volume.
                </p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">That Time I Was Reincarnated As A Slime</h3>
                <p>
                    It's the perfect balance of serious and funny, and the story is well made. The characters are enjoyable and well put together.
                    It's a reincarnated story where someone was made into a slime. For those of you who've never played a fantasy rpg, a slime is a early game enemy.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Sword Art Online</h3>
                <p>
                    Most people hate it, but i think it has beautifully designed characters.
                    It's based off of it's light novel, and each season adds more wonderfully made world and characters.
                    It's a FDVR anime as well, and it's great!
